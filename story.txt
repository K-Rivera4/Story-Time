One day a hund named Schatze decided to stage the ultimate heist, stealing a Bratworst from the Schloss Eltz.
Schatze's daring escape led him down the Hauptstrasse, where he cleverly dodged passersby and disappeared into the bustling crowd.
Amidst the crowd, Schatze suddenly became hungry despite the Bratworst from before, so he ran into a Ratskeller and ordered a Doener kebab.
After visiting Schloss Eltz and admiring its grandeur, we sat in a Biergarten enjoying Bratwurst and Apfelkuchen.
Now Schatze realized he is running late, so he left the biergarten and stole a BMW X5 just idled in the parking lot.
His next destination was the Flughafen, where he hoped to catch a quick flight out of town.
In Berlin, we walked down Hauptstrasse to a Baeckerei where we bought fresh Brot and delicious Gebaeck.
Schatze navigated the labyrinthine streets of Berlin with the stolen goods and newfound treasure weighing heavily in his backpack.
While enjoying our food in Berlin we noticed this strange hund carrying a bag and hopping into a BMW, slipping by right under the dirndl of the cars owner. 
As the sun set over Berlin, Schatze, laden with his treasure, disappeared into the dusk, leaving behind a trail of mystery.
He also left a scent trail from the Bratworst, Doener, apfelkuchen, and gebaeck.
